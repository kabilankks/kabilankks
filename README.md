## 👨‍💻Hello there I'm Kabilan, an IT Specialist👋
I'm currently pursuing my degree with a strong passion for networking, system administration, and cloud computing. In my free time, I build homelab projects to experiment with virtualization, self-hosted services, and network automation.

I designed and implemented a complete cloud infrastructure on AWS to create a scalable and secure network architecture that supports both public and private services.
### • <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/svg/docker.svg" alt="Docker Logo" height="20"> [Setting Up Docker & Portainer on CentOS](https://github.com/kabilankks/dockerkks) <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/svg/portainer.svg" alt="Portainer Logo" height="20">
I installed Docker and Portainer on a CentOS server in my homelab to manage containers through a simple web UI. This setup helps me deploy, monitor, and experiment with self-hosted services more efficiently.
### • [🗂️ Ditching Monthly Subcrptions with Immich](https://github.com/kabilankks/imagekks) <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons/svg/immich.svg" alt="Immich Logo" height="20">
To cut monthly cloud storage costs, I self-hosted Immich — an open-source Google Photos alternative. It runs in Docker and automatically backs up photos while giving me full control over my data.
