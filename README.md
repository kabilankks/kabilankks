<h2>👨‍💻Hello there I'm Kabilan, an IT Systems Admin👋</h2>
<p>
I'm currently pursuing my degree with a strong passion for networking, system administration, and cloud computing.
In my free time, I build homelab projects to experiment with virtualization, self-hosted services, and network automation.
